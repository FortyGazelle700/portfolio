# Portfolio

## Project Background

This portfolio project showcases my skills in web development and design, structured to be both a digital resume and a visual display of my coding style and approach. Built with Next.js and MDX, it features interactive elements and dynamic content, making it easy for visitors to navigate my projects and skills.

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this portfolio was to design an organized, multi-page application that includes a main landing page along with detail-oriented pages for each project and skill set. I wanted a seamless way for employers, clients, and collaborators to learn about my technical abilities, experience, and background without overwhelming them with information upfront.

## Design Decisions

To achieve a clean, user-friendly experience, I decided on a multi-page structure where each section serves a specific purpose. Key design decisions included:

- **Main Landing Page**: Introduces my background and expertise with a strategically designed layout. Features key achievements, technical skills, and a clear path to explore more detailed sections. Includes an engaging hero section with animated elements to capture attention.
- **Competition Pages**: Highlights from hackathons and coding competitions, focusing on successes in both solo and team challenges. Demonstrates real-world problem-solving ability with tangible examples.
- **Project Pages**: Showcases completed projects through detailed case studies, including design process, technology choices, and implementation details. Each project has its own dedicated space for both code examples and live demos.

Using a component-based structure in Next.js, I ensured consistency across the site while enabling rapid updates for each section.

## Development Process

I began by setting up the application with Next.js, using MDX to make content updates more manageable. This allowed me to integrate rich text and visuals seamlessly. Each page was carefully optimized to ensure smooth navigation and a responsive design across devices, from desktops to mobile.

## Project Completion and Next Steps

The portfolio is live and fully functional, serving as a professional online presence for my web development skills. I plan to add a blog section soon, using MDX for easy content management, which will provide insights into my development approach and recent projects.
